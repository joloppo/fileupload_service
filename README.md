# FastAPI Fileuploader

# How to use (using [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#cross-platform)):
 - `just dev` -> this starts the api locally
 - `just docker-up` -> starts the api in docker, locally, access using localhost:8000
 - `just docker-down` -> stops the docker container & removes it

# Things I didn't do that I would do:
 - Add tests
 - MAP Project Errors to HTTP Errors [!!!NB], might do it in a minute
